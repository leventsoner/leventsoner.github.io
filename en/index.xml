        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugo is a fast static site generator. This post covers the minimal workflow: create a site, run a dev server, add content, and build for production.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Case For Free Trade</title>

        <description>Core Argument The Friedmans argue that despite near-unanimous agreement among economists since Adam Smith that free trade benefits all participating countries, protectionist policies persist due to special interest influence. They contend that free trade should be pursued unilaterally, even if other nations maintain trade barriers.
Key Points  Consumer Perspective vs. Special Interests:  Consumer voices are &amp;ldquo;drowned out&amp;rdquo; by merchants, manufacturers, and workers seeking protection Tariffs (&amp;ldquo;protection&amp;rdquo;) ultimately exploit consumers rather than help them   Correcting Common Misconceptions:  Jobs for their own sake aren&amp;rsquo;t valuable; productive jobs that increase goods and services are what matter Exports aren&amp;rsquo;t inherently good and imports bad; imports are what we actually consume and benefit from Exports are merely &amp;ldquo;the price we pay to get imports&amp;rdquo; A &amp;ldquo;favorable&amp;rdquo; balance of trade (exporting more than importing) is actually disadvantageous to citizens   The Exchange Rate Mechanism:  The Friedmans use a hypothetical example of Japan producing everything cheaper than the US They explain how exchange rates would naturally adjust through market forces If Japanese goods were cheaper, Americans would buy Japanese goods with dollars Japanese exporters would need to exchange dollars for yen The dollar would depreciate until goods from both countries reached equilibrium prices This automatic adjustment eliminates any persistent &amp;ldquo;balance of payments problem&amp;rdquo; in free markets   Why Currency Crises Occur:  Government central banks interfere with natural exchange rate adjustments This prevents gradual market corrections and leads to accumulated distortions The result is periodic major foreign exchange &amp;ldquo;crises&amp;rdquo;   Three Potentially Valid Arguments for Tariffs:  National Security: May justify maintaining otherwise uneconomical industries (like steel) for defense purposes, though cost comparisons with alternatives are rarely made Infant Industry: Temporarily protecting new industries until they mature, but the Friedmans view this as a &amp;ldquo;smoke screen&amp;rdquo; since &amp;ldquo;the so-called infants never grow up&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Beggar-Thy-Neighbor&amp;rdquo;: Countries with monopoly positions could theoretically benefit from export tariffs (like OPEC), but this typically invites retaliation   The Retaliation Fallacy:  They reject the argument that the US can&amp;rsquo;t practice free trade until other countries do When other countries restrict trade, they harm both themselves and us Adding our own restrictions compounds the damage rather than fixing it Retaliatory actions typically lead to further restrictions, not fewer   Call for Unilateral Free Trade:  The US should move to complete free trade over a five-year period This would promote freedom both domestically and internationally Instead of foreign aid (promoting socialism) while restricting imports (hindering free enterprise), the US should adopt a consistent stance of economic freedom    The Friedmans conclude that few policies would do more to promote freedom globally than the US embracing complete free trade, allowing worldwide cooperation among individuals without government interference.</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses algorithms called neural networks to learn from data. These algorithms are inspired by the structure and function of the brain, and are able to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
