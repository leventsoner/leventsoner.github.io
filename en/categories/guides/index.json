[{"content":"Hugo is a fast static site generator. This post covers the minimal workflow: create a site, run a dev server, add content, and build for production.\nInstall Hugo On Linux (Snap):\n1 2  sudo snap install hugo hugo version   Alternatively, install via your distro package manager (often the hugo package) or download the extended release if your theme uses SCSS/SASS.\nCreate a new site 1 2  hugo new site my-blog cd my-blog   This creates a skeleton like:\n hugo.toml (or config.toml): site configuration content/: your Markdown pages and posts themes/: themes  Add a theme Most themes are installed as a git submodule. Example:\n1 2  git init git submodule add \u0026lt;THEME_REPO_URL\u0026gt; themes/\u0026lt;theme-name\u0026gt;   Then set your theme in config (example in hugo.toml):\n1  theme = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;theme-name\u0026gt;\u0026#34;   Run the dev server 1  hugo server -D    -D includes draft content. Hugo will print a local URL (often http://localhost:1313/).  Create a new post If you’re inside your Hugo project, you can generate a new content file like this:\n1  hugo new content/en/posts/my-first-post.md   Since you’re authoring in Obsidian and syncing to Hugo, you can also create/edit Markdown files directly in your vault under:\n content/en/posts/ for English posts  Just keep front matter at the top of each file.\nFront matter essentials Hugo reads metadata from front matter (YAML/TOML/JSON). Common fields:\n title: post title date: publish date/time draft: true to hide from production builds tags, categories: taxonomy terms  Example (YAML):\n1 2 3 4 5 6  ---title:\u0026#34;My First Post\u0026#34;date:2026-02-10T12:00:00+03:00draft:truetags:[\u0026#34;hugo\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;notes\u0026#34;]---  Build the site 1  hugo   This generates a production-ready site into public/.\nDeploy (common approach)  Commit your Hugo project to git. Let your host build it (Netlify/Cloudflare Pages/GitHub Actions/etc.), or build locally and upload public/.  Handy tips  Archetypes: define default front matter/templates for new content in archetypes/. Multilingual: keep content/en/, content/tr/, etc., and configure languages in your Hugo config. Obsidian compatibility: prefer standard Markdown + Hugo shortcodes; avoid Obsidian-only syntax unless your renderer/theme supports it.

They contend that free trade should be pursued unilaterally, even if other nations maintain trade barriers.\nKey Points  Consumer Perspective vs. Special Interests:  Consumer voices are \u0026ldquo;drowned out\u0026rdquo; by merchants, manufacturers, and workers seeking protection Tariffs (\u0026ldquo;protection\u0026rdquo;) ultimately exploit consumers rather than help them   Correcting Common Misconceptions:  Jobs for their own sake aren\u0026rsquo;t valuable; productive jobs that increase goods and services are what matter Exports aren\u0026rsquo;t inherently good and imports bad; imports are what we actually consume and benefit from Exports are merely \u0026ldquo;the price we pay to get imports\u0026rdquo; A \u0026ldquo;favorable\u0026rdquo; balance of trade (exporting more than importing) is actually disadvantageous to citizens   The Exchange Rate Mechanism:  The Friedmans use a hypothetical example of Japan producing everything cheaper than the US They explain how exchange rates would naturally adjust through market forces If Japanese goods were cheaper, Americans would buy Japanese goods with dollars Japanese exporters would need to exchange dollars for yen The dollar would depreciate until goods from both countries reached equilibrium prices This automatic adjustment eliminates any persistent \u0026ldquo;balance of payments problem\u0026rdquo; in free markets   Why Currency Crises Occur:  Government central banks interfere with natural exchange rate adjustments This prevents gradual market corrections and leads to accumulated distortions The result is periodic major foreign exchange \u0026ldquo;crises\u0026rdquo;   Three Potentially Valid Arguments for Tariffs:  National Security: May justify maintaining otherwise uneconomical industries (like steel) for defense purposes, though cost comparisons with alternatives are rarely made Infant Industry: Temporarily protecting new industries until they mature, but the Friedmans view this as a \u0026ldquo;smoke screen\u0026rdquo; since \u0026ldquo;the so-called infants never grow up\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Beggar-Thy-Neighbor\u0026rdquo;: Countries with monopoly positions could theoretically benefit from export tariffs (like OPEC), but this typically invites retaliation   The Retaliation Fallacy:  They reject the argument that the US can\u0026rsquo;t practice free trade until other countries do When other countries restrict trade, they harm both themselves and us Adding our own restrictions compounds the damage rather than fixing it Retaliatory actions typically lead to further restrictions, not fewer   Call for Unilateral Free Trade:  The US should move to complete free trade over a five-year period This would promote freedom both domestically and internationally Instead of foreign aid (promoting socialism) while restricting imports (hindering free enterprise), the US should adopt a consistent stance of economic freedom    The Friedmans conclude that few policies would do more to promote freedom globally than the US embracing complete free trade, allowing worldwide cooperation among individuals without government interference.\n","description":"Here Milton Friedman and Rose Friedman discuss what does important in international trade.","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"The Case For Free Trade","uri":"https://leventsoner.github.io/en/posts/the-case-for-free-trade/"},{"content":"Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses algorithms called neural networks to learn from data. These algorithms are inspired by the structure and function of the brain, and are able to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.\nOne of the key components of deep learning is the use of loss functions and optimization algorithms. These are used to train the neural network, by measuring the error between the predicted output of the network and the actual desired output, and then adjusting the network\u0026rsquo;s parameters to reduce the error.\nThere are many different types of loss functions and optimization algorithms, but some of the most commonly used ones in the field of computer vision include:\n  Mean squared error (MSE): This is a common loss function used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous value. The MSE is calculated by taking the average of the squares of the differences between the predicted and actual values.\n  Binary cross entropy (BCE): This loss function is used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict one of two classes (e.g. \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo;). The BCE is calculated by taking the negative log of the predicted probability of the correct class.\n  Categorical cross entropy (CCE): This loss function is similar to BCE, but is used for multi-class classification tasks, where the goal is to predict one of many possible classes (e.g. \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;bird\u0026rdquo;, etc.). The CCE is calculated by taking the negative log of the predicted probability of the correct class.\n  Stochastic gradient descent (SGD): This is a popular optimization algorithm used to train neural networks. It works by randomly selecting a batch of training data and then using the gradient of the loss function with respect to the network\u0026rsquo;s parameters to update the parameters in a way that reduces the loss.\n  Adam: This is another popular optimization algorithm that is often used in deep learning. It combines the ideas of SGD and momentum to provide a faster and more stable convergence to the optimal solution.\n  To use these loss functions and optimization algorithms in a deep learning model, you will need to first define the architecture of the model, including the number and type of layers, and the activation functions used in each layer. You will then need to load and pre-process your training data, and specify the loss function and optimization algorithm that you want to use.\nOnce the model is set up, you can start training it by passing the training data through the network and using the loss function and optimization algorithm to adjust the network\u0026rsquo;s parameters. As the model trains, the error between the predicted and actual outputs will decrease, and the accuracy of the model will improve.\nI hope this helps give you a general overview of loss functions and optimization in the context of deep learning and computer vision. There are many other important concepts and techniques in deep learning, so if you want to learn more, I recommend doing some additional research and reading on the subject.\n","description":"Brief info about optimization techniques in deep learning practises","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":["machine learning"],"title":"Deep Learning Optimization","uri":"https://leventsoner.github.io/en/posts/deep-learning-optimization/"},{"content":"Sample images from Pixabay\n","description":"cartoon gallery","id":3,"section":"gallery","tags":null,"title":"Cartoon","uri":"https://leventsoner.github.io/en/gallery/cartoon/"},{"content":"Sample images from Pixabay\n","description":"photo gallery","id":4,"section":"gallery","tags":null,"title":"Photo","uri":"https://leventsoner.github.io/en/gallery/photo/"},{"content":"Written in Go, Hugo is an open source static site generator available under the Apache Licence 2.0.
